## Why Formistic

Most form plugins stop at "email me the submission." Formistic picks up where
they leave off and gives you a complete **submission operations** workflow:

- **One inbox for everything.** Captures from the built-in Formistic forms plus
  Contact Form 7, WPForms, Gravity Forms, Fluent Forms, and compatible theme
  form handlers — all in a single, searchable list with a clear status flow
  (`New → Viewed → Replied`).
- **Reply without leaving WordPress.** A built-in composer with saved templates,
  quote-original, CC/BCC, signatures, and HTML mode.
- **Keep your list clean.** Newsletter sign-ups land in a dedicated Newsletter
  tab; contact messages land in the Inbox — never mixed.
- **Automate the routine.** Auto-responders and a simple `keyword => template`
  rule engine reply for you.
- **Stay protected.** Honeypot, rate limiting, reCAPTCHA v3, Cloudflare
  Turnstile, Akismet, and an IP blocklist.
- **Prove the value.** An analytics dashboard with submission volume, response
  KPIs, SLA overdue tracking, and per-form conversion.

## Dashboard

After activation a top-level **Formistic** menu appears in wp-admin with these
screens, in order:

1. **Inbox** — every submission, with search, filters, detail view, and replies.
2. **Forms** — build unlimited forms with the field editor.
3. **Newsletter** — subscribers captured from sign-up forms, with CSV export.
4. **Threads** — submissions grouped by sender.
5. **Analytics** — volume, response time, SLA, and conversion metrics.
6. **Settings** — General, Captures, Spam, Auto-Responder, Attachments, GDPR,
   Webhooks, Reply Templates, and AI & Automation.
